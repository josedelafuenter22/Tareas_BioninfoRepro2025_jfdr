This repository is made for the Bioinformatics course work.

I'm Jos√© de la Fuente, i have a degree in biology. I'm actually taking this semester a Bioinformatics course on Wednesdays.
I'm going to publish my assigments everyweek in this repository.

Each directory correspond to the assigments for each session. The name of directory is "claseX", where X corresponds to the session number.
